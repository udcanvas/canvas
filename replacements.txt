find and replace all file paths for both html and php

php replacement paths - always replace site relative php paths FIRST

site relative /www/git/canvas/<folder> replaces /www/canvas/<folder> or /www/LTI436

html replacements /git/canvas/<folder> replaces /canvas/<folder>

check for strays: search for .php




overview - we use 8 - 10 mysql functions in php that have been deprecated in favor of mysqli functions. Most of the new functions have the same name, but with some important differences.

Category 1 : same name, but different parameters. Old fns had an option $link param, usually second, but would infor your most recent $link if it was omitted. New version requires $link as first param.

real_escape_string - reverse order of params! ($link,string)
query - ($link,string)
error - ($link)
close - ($link)

find: mysql_(real_escape_string|error|query|close)\(
 
and replace with:   mysqli_$1($link,

but be careful, in case original might have had the $link param as second

----------------------------------------------

Category 2 - no direct replacement

mysql_result($result,0) -> mysqli_fetch_field($result)

Category 3 - direct replacement, these are mostly those that took $result as a lone argument

num_rows - direct conversion
mysql_fetch_assoc - direct conversion
mysql_fetch_array -direct conversion

find: mysql_(fetch_assoc|fetch_array|num_rows) 

and replace with: mysqli_$1
